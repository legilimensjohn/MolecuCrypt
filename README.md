# MolecuCrypt

MolecuCrypt is a simple Python GUI application for encrypting and decrypting text using a custom "molecular" encoding scheme. It converts text to binary, applies a circular bit shift, and then encodes the result using molecular bond symbols (`-`, `=`, `â‰¡`). The tool also supports decryption and provides a step-by-step manual decryption mode for educational purposes.

- Encryption: Converts text to binary, shifts bits, and encodes using molecular symbols.
- Decryption: Reverses the process to recover the original text.
- Manual Decrypt: Shows each step of the decryption process for learning.
- GUI: Built with Tkinter for an easy-to-use interface.

Great for learning about binary encoding, bitwise operations, and custom ciphers!
